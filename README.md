- **Selling Price**: Actual selling price (target variable)
- **Sale Date**: Date of sale

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Seaborn**: Statistical visualizations
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting algorithm
- **CuML**: GPU-accelerated machine learning (for Random Forest)

## üìù Key Features

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Column Standardization**: Capitalized and renamed columns for consistency
- **State Code Mapping**: Converted state codes to full state names (including US states and Canadian provinces)
- **Brand Standardization**: Clustered and standardized similar brand names
- **Missing Value Handling**: Implemented intelligent filling strategies:
  - Model, Trim, and Body: Filled based on similar vehicle profiles
  - Market Price & Selling Price: Filled using mean values of similar vehicles
  - Color and Interior: Filled with top-occurring values
- **Duplicate Removal**: Removed duplicate records based on VIN
- **Outlier Removal**: Applied IQR (Interquartile Range) method and Isolation Forest algorithm

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Statistical Summary**: Descriptive statistics for all features
- **Visualization of Top Brands**: Analysis of most popular car brands
- **Price Distribution Analysis**: Box plots and distributions for market prices
- **Correlation Analysis**: Relationship between Market Price and Selling Price
- **Geographic Analysis**: Top 10 states by sales volume with pie charts

### 3. Statistical Hypothesis Testing
- **Transmission Analysis**: T-test to compare prices between Automatic and Manual transmissions
- **Odometer Impact**: Z-test to analyze the effect of high vs. low mileage on selling prices

### 4. Machine Learning Models

#### Implemented Models:
1. **Polynomial Regression** (degree=2)
   - R¬≤ Score: 0.95
   - Explained 95% of variance in selling prices
   
2. **XGBoost Regressor**
   - R¬≤ Score: 0.95
   - Strong predictive performance
   
3. **Random Forest Regressor**
   - R¬≤ Score: 0.93 (standard)
   - R¬≤ Score: 0.95 (with GridSearchCV optimization)
   - GPU-accelerated implementation using CuML

#### Preprocessing Pipeline:
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Standard scaling for numerical features
- Train-test split (80-20)

## üìä Key Insights

1. **Strong Price Correlation**: Market Price and Selling Price show a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.97, indicating high predictability
2. **Brand Analysis**: Luxury brands (BMW, etc.) show higher median prices with wider price ranges
3. **Popular Brands**: Ford, Chevrolet, and Nissan are among the most frequently sold brands
4. **Geographic Distribution**: Sales are concentrated in specific states, with California and Texas leading
5. **Transmission Impact**: Statistical tests reveal significant differences in prices based on transmission type
